## Classifying Images as Clothing

Neural network model trained to classify images as clothing using the tf.keras API. Much of the code here is taken from the tutorial section of tensorflow.org and is intended for academic use only. The full documentation can be found [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification).

## Project Details

The dataset used to train and test this model is the Fashion MNIST dataset which can be found [here](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist). It contains 70,000 grayscale images that can be put in into 10 categories: T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, and Ankle boot. These images show individual articles of clothing at low resolution (28x28 pixels). The classic MNIST dataset may be familiar to most people - as it is credited by many as the "Hello, World" of ML. The use of the Fashion dataset in this project is more for variety because of this.
